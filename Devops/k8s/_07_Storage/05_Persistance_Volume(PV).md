Introduction
    In large Kubernetes environments, configuring storage for each pod individually is impractical.
    Persistent Volumes (PVs) provide a solution by creating a cluster-wide pool of storage volumes.
    Users can claim storage from this pool using Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs).

Persistent Volume Configuration
    Admin configures PVs to be used by users.
    PVs defined centrally, available for users to claim.

Creating a Persistent Volume
    Start with a base template, update API version, set kind to PersistentVolume.
    Name the PV and specify access modes (e.g., ReadOnlyMany, ReadWriteOnce).
    Define capacity (storage size) and volume type (e.g., hostPath for local directory storage).

Example Workflow
    Create PV using kubectl create command.
    List created PVs using kubectl get persistentvolume command.

Supported Storage Solutions
    Beyond hostPath, other supported solutions include AWS Elastic Block Store, etc.
    Admins can configure PVs with appropriate storage solutions for the cluster's needs.

Usage in Production
    hostPath option not recommended for production due to limitations.
    Use supported storage solutions suitable for production environments.
