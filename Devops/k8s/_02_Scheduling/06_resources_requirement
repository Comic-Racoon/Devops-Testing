    Resource Management in Kubernetes:
        Nodes have CPU and memory resources.
        Pods require resources to run.
        Kubernetes scheduler decides pod placement based on resource availability.

    Resource Requests and Limits:
        Resource requests: Minimum resources required by a pod.
        Limits: Maximum resources a pod can consume.

    Specifying Resource Requirements:
        Add resources section in pod-definition file.
        Specify requests and limits for CPU and memory.

    CPU and Memory Resource Units:
        CPU: Expressed in vCPUs, cores, or hyperthreads.
        Memory: Expressed in MiB, GiB, or MB, GB.

    Throttling and Out of Memory Events:
        CPU: Throttled if exceeds limit.
        Memory: Pod terminated with OOM error if exceeds limit.

    Default Resource Configuration:
        Kubernetes default: No resource requests or limits.
        Pods can consume available resources on the node.

    CPU Resource Requests and Limits:
        Different scenarios: No request or limit, only limit, both set, only request.
        Setting requests without limits allows flexible resource usage.

----

    Limit Ranges: (is a crd kind) 
        Define default resource values for pods at the namespace level.
        Specifies default, max, and min values for CPU and memory resources.

    Resource Quotas:(is a crd kind)
        Namespace-level objects to set hard limits on resource consumption.
        Ensure total resource usage across all pods in a namespace stays within defined limits.
