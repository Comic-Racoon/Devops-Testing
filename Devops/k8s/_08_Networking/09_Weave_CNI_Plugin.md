The Weave CNI plugin operates by deploying an agent or service, called Weave peers, on each node within the Kubernetes cluster. These agents communicate with each other to exchange information about the nodes, networks, and pods within the cluster. They maintain a topology of the entire setup, allowing them to know about the pods and their IP addresses on other nodes.

Here's how the Weave CNI plugin works:

    Deployment of Weave Peers:
        Weave peers are deployed as services or daemons on each node in the Kubernetes cluster.
        They communicate with each other to exchange information about the cluster's topology.

    Topology Management:
        Each Weave peer stores a topology of the entire cluster, including information about nodes, networks, and pods.
        This topology allows Weave peers to know about pods and their IP addresses on other nodes.

    Bridge Creation and IP Assignment:
        Weave creates its own bridge on each node, named Weave bridge.
        Each bridge is assigned IP addresses for the network.

    Intercepting and Routing Packets:
        When a packet is sent from one pod to another on a different node, Weave intercepts the packet.
        Weave identifies that the packet is on a separate network and encapsulates it into a new packet with new source and destination information.
        The encapsulated packet is then sent across the network.
        Upon reaching the destination node, the receiving Weave agent retrieves the packet, decapsulates it, and routes it to the correct pod.

    Deployment in Kubernetes:
        Weave can be deployed in the Kubernetes cluster using kubectl apply command.
        Once the base Kubernetes system is set up, Weave can be deployed with this command, which includes deploying necessary components for Weave in the cluster.
        Importantly, the Weave peers are deployed as a daemon set, ensuring that one pod of the Weave peer is deployed on all nodes in the cluster.

Overall, the Weave CNI plugin simplifies networking in Kubernetes clusters by deploying agents on each node to manage communication, topology, and routing between pods. This approach ensures efficient communication between pods across the cluster, regardless of their location.
