Introduction to Network Namespaces in Linux

    Understanding Namespace Concept
        Analogizing namespaces to rooms in a house, providing isolation for processes.
        Highlighting the visibility of processes from the parent namespace.

    Network Namespace for Container Isolation
        Creating a network namespace for a container to isolate it from the host network.
        Demonstrating how processes appear differently within a container.

    Isolating Network Information
        Ensuring containers have no visibility of host network details.
        Showing the absence of network-related information within a container.

    Creating and Managing Network Namespaces
        Using the ip netns add command to create network namespaces.
        Listing network namespaces with the ip netns command.

    Viewing Network Interfaces within Namespaces
        Using ip link command within a namespace to view interfaces.
        Demonstrating the isolation of network interfaces between namespaces.

    Establishing Connectivity between Namespaces
        Creating virtual ethernet pairs to connect namespaces.
        Assigning IP addresses and bringing up interfaces within namespaces.
        Testing connectivity between namespaces using ping.

    Scaling Connectivity with Virtual Switches
        Creating a virtual switch (Linux bridge) within the host.
        Connecting namespaces to the virtual switch for broader connectivity.
        Assigning IP addresses and enabling interfaces for communication.

    Routing and Gateway Setup
        Configuring routing tables within namespaces for external network access.
        Identifying the host as a gateway for inter-network communication.
        Enabling NAT (Network Address Translation) for internet connectivity.

    Accessing Services within Namespaces
        Forwarding ports from the host to namespaces using IP tables.
        Enabling access to services hosted within namespaces from the outside world.

By following this guide, users will gain a comprehensive understanding of network namespaces in Linux, including their creation, management, and configuration for network isolation and connectivity within container environments.
