In Kubernetes, IP address management (IPAM) for pods involves assigning IP addresses to containers within pods. Here's how it works:

    Responsibility:
        According to the Container Network Interface (CNI) standards, it is the responsibility of the CNI plugin, or the network solution provider, to assign IP addresses to containers.

    Implementation:
        IP address management can be implemented within the CNI plugin or outsourced to built-in IPAM plugins provided by CNI.
        The built-in IPAM plugins include options like "host-local," which manages IP addresses locally on each host.

    CNI Configuration:
        The CNI configuration file includes an IPAM section where the type of IPAM plugin, subnet, and routes can be specified.
        This configuration can be read from scripts to invoke the appropriate IPAM plugin dynamically.

    Host-Local Plugin:
        The host-local plugin, for example, manages IP addresses locally on each host. However, it's the responsibility of the script to invoke this plugin.
        The script can be made dynamic to support different IPAM plugins.

    Weaveworks IPAM:
        Weaveworks, for instance, allocates a default IP range of 10.32.0.0/12 for the entire network, providing a large pool of IP addresses for pods.
        Within this range, each node is assigned a portion of IP addresses, and pods created on these nodes receive IP addresses from that range.
        Weaveworks allows for configurable IP address ranges during plugin deployment.

Overall, IP address management in Kubernetes involves ensuring that containers within pods are assigned unique IP addresses, and this task can be handled by the CNI plugin or outsourced to built-in IPAM plugins like host-local or solutions provided by network solution providers like Weaveworks.
