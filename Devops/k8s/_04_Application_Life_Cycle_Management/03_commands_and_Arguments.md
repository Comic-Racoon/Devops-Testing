    Command Field:
        Corresponds to the ENTRYPOINT instruction in the Dockerfile.
        Specifies the command to be executed when the container starts.
        Overrides the ENTRYPOINT instruction in the Dockerfile.

    Args Field:
        Corresponds to the CMD instruction in the Dockerfile.
        Allows additional arguments or parameters to be passed to the command specified in the command field.
        Overrides the CMD instruction in the Dockerfile.

    Usage:
        Use the command field to specify the main executable or script to run within the container.
        Use the args field to provide additional parameters or arguments to the main command.
        Together, they allow customization of the container's startup behavior.

    Relationship with Dockerfile:
        Understanding the relationship between Kubernetes pod definition files and Dockerfiles helps in configuring container behavior effectively.
        Commands and arguments specified in the pod definition file override the corresponding instructions in the Dockerfile.

By leveraging the command and args fields appropriately in pod definition files, you can customize the behavior of containers to suit your application requirements.
