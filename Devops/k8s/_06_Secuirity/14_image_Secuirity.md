Basics of Image Names:
    Docker Image Naming Convention:
        Image names follow Docker's naming convention.
        Example: nginx refers to the library/nginx image.
    Repository Name:
        The first part of the image name is the repository name.
        library is the default account for Docker's official images.
        Custom repositories would use the account or company name.
    Registry Location:
        Images are pulled from Docker's default registry, Docker Hub (docker.io).
        Other popular registries include Google's registry (gcr.io) and private registries.

Private Registries:
    Hosting Private Images:
        Private images are hosted on private registries.
        Cloud providers like AWS, Azure, GCP offer private registries.
    Access Control:
        Private repositories require authentication for access.
        Images can be made private to restrict access to authorized users.

Authentication with Private Registries:
    Docker Login:
        Authenticate with private registries using docker login.
        Input credentials to log in to the private registry.
    Kubernetes Integration:
        Kubernetes needs credentials to access private registries.
        Credentials are passed to the Docker runtime on worker nodes.
    Creating Docker Registry Secret:
        Create a secret object (regcred) with Docker registry credentials.
        Specify registry server name, username, password, and email.
    Usage in Pod Definition:
        Specify the secret in the pod definition under the imagePullSecrets section.
        Kubernetes uses the credentials from the secret to pull images when creating pods.

Implementation Steps:
    Create Docker registry secret with credentials.
    Specify the secret in the pod definition.
    Kubernetes uses the secret to authenticate and pull images from the private registry.

Security Considerations:
    Private registries offer better control over image access.
    Use strong credentials and manage access carefully.
    Regularly review and update registry access policies.
