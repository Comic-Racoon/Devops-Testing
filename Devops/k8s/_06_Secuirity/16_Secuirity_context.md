Security Configuration in Kubernetes:

    Scope of Configuration:
        Security settings can be defined at the container or Pod level.
        Configuration at the Pod level applies to all containers within the Pod.
        Container-level configuration overrides Pod-level settings.

Pod Definition Example:

yaml

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: my-container
    image: ubuntu
    command: ["sleep", "3600"]

Configuring Security Context:

    Pod Level:
        Define security settings under the spec section of the Pod.
        Use securityContext field.
        Example: Setting the user ID for the Pod.

        yaml

    spec:
      securityContext:
        runAsUser: 1000

Container Level:

    Move the security context section under the container specification.
    Pod-level settings are overridden by container-level settings.
    Example: Setting the user ID for the container.

    yaml

        spec:
          containers:
          - name: my-container
            securityContext:
              runAsUser: 1000
            image: ubuntu
            command: ["sleep", "3600"]

Adding Capabilities:

    Use the capabilities field to specify Linux capabilities.
    Example: Adding capabilities to the Pod.

    yaml

    spec:
      securityContext:
        capabilities:
          add: ["NET_ADMIN", "SYS_TIME"]

Note:

    Experiment with different security settings to enforce security standards.
    Understand the implications of configuring security settings at different levels in Kubernetes Pods.
