Identify Certificate Files:

    Navigate to /etc/kubernetes/manifests directory.
    Locate the Kubernetes API server definition file.
    Note down the paths of all certificate files used by the API server for different purposes (e.g., TLS certificate, key files).

Inspect Certificate Details:

    Use the OpenSSL command (openssl x509 -in <certificate_file> -text) to decode each certificate file.
    Check the following details:
        Subject: Ensure the correct name is specified (e.g., Kube-API Server).
        Alternate Names: Verify all alternate names are present.
        Validity: Check the expiration date to ensure the certificates are not expired.
        Issuer: Ensure the issuer matches the expected CA (e.g., Kubernetes).

Document Certificate Information:

    Create a spreadsheet or document to list all certificate files with their corresponding details (e.g., paths, names, alternate names, organization, expiration date, issuer).

Review Certificate Requirements:

    Refer to the Kubernetes documentation for detailed certificate requirements and guidelines.

Troubleshoot Certificate Issues:

    If issues are encountered, start by checking logs:
        For clusters set up manually:
            Use the operating system's logging functionality to review service logs.
        For clusters provisioned by Cube ADM:
            Use kubectl logs <pod_name> command to view logs of the relevant pods.
            If core components are down, use Docker commands (docker ps -a, docker logs <container_id>) to fetch logs.

Ensure Correct Configuration:

    Verify that certificates have the right names, alternate names, organization, and issuer.
    Ensure certificates are not expired and meet Kubernetes requirements.

Document Findings and Recommendations:

    Record any issues found during the health check.
    Provide recommendations for resolving identified issues and maintaining certificate health in the cluster.
