Securing Access to Kubernetes Cluster with Authentication Mechanisms:

    Introduction:
        Kubernetes cluster access involves various user types: administrators, developers, and third-party applications.
        End users accessing applications deployed on the cluster are managed by the applications themselves.
        Focus on securing access for administrative purposes and integrating with external services.

    User Management in Kubernetes:
        Kubernetes does not atively manage user accounts but relies on external sources like files, certificates, or third-party identity services.
        Service accounts can be managed within Kubernetes using the API.

    Authentication Mechanisms in Kubernetes:
        Authentication in Kubernetes is managed by the API server, which authenticates requests before processing them.
        Different authentication mechanisms can be configured:
            Static password files: List of users and passwords in a CSV file.
            Static token files: List of users and tokens in a file.
            Certificates: Authentication using certificates.
            Integration with third-party protocols like LDAP or Kerberos.

    Static Password and Token Files:
        Users and passwords stored in a CSV file, passed as an option to the Kube API server.
        Password file must be specified in the Kube API server configuration, followed by a server restart.
        Authentication using basic credentials while accessing the API server, specifying user and password in a curl command.
        Similar setup for token authentication, using a token file and specifying the token in the request.

    Security Considerations:
        Storing usernames, passwords, and tokens in clear text in static files is insecure and not recommended.
        These mechanisms are simplistic and lack robust security features.
        Best practice is to use more secure authentication methods, such as certificates or integration with external identity services.

By understanding and implementing secure authentication mechanisms, administrators can control access to the Kubernetes cluster and ensure that only authorized users and applications can interact with the cluster's resources.
