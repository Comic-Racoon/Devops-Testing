# Observability and the Outline Method

## Introduction
Observability is the ability to understand and measure the state of a system based on data generated by the system. It enables actionable insights from unexpected scenarios in dynamic environments. This note outlines the concept of observability and its three pillars: Logging, Metrics, and Traces.

## What is Observability?
- **Definition**: The ability to understand and measure the state of a system based on generated data.
- **Benefits**:
  1. Provides insight into system/application internals.
  2. Speeds up troubleshooting.
  3. Detects hard-to-catch problems.
  4. Monitors application performance.
  5. Improves cross-team collaboration.
- **Purpose**: To understand complex system architectures and address new challenges, especially in distributed systems and microservices-based applications.
- **Need for Observability**: As systems become more complex, tracking down issues becomes more challenging, requiring more information than just identifying what is wrong.

## Three Pillars of Observability
1. **Logging**:
   - Records events with timestamp and information.
   - Most common form of observation, but can be verbose and difficult to use.
2. **Metrics**:
   - Provide numerical information about the state of a system.
   - Examples include CPU load, HTTP response times, etc.
   - Aggregated and graphed over time for trend analysis.
3. **Traces**:
   - Allow tracking of operations as they traverse through systems and services.
   - Help understand how processes and services work together.
   - Consist of spans with start time, duration, and parent ID.

## How to Accomplish Observability
- **Logs**: Records of events with timestamp and message.
- **Metrics**: Numerical values indicating system state.
- **Traces**: Follows operations through systems and services.

## Conclusion
Observability is crucial for understanding and maintaining complex systems. By leveraging logging, metrics, and traces, teams can gain valuable insights into system behavior, enabling better troubleshooting and performance monitoring.
