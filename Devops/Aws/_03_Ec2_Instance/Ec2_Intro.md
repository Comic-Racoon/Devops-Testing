# Amazon EC2
* EC2 is one of the most popular of AWS’ offering
* EC2 = Elastic Compute Cloud = Infrastructure as a Service
* It mainly consists in the capability of :
  * Renting virtual machines (EC2)
  * Storing data on virtual drives (EBS)
  * Distributing load across machines (ELB)
  * Scaling the services using an auto-scaling group (ASG)
* Knowing EC2 is fundamental to understand how the Cloud works

# EC2 sizing & configuration options
* Operating System (OS): Linux, Windows or Mac OS
* How much compute power & cores (CPU)
* How much random-access memory (RAM)
* How much storage space:
  * Network-attached (EBS & EFS)
  * hardware (EC2 Instance Store)
* Network card: speed of the card, Public IP address
* Firewall rules: security group
* Bootstrap script (configure at first launch): EC2 User Data

---

# EC2 User Data
* It is possible to bootstrap our instances using an EC2 User data script.
* bootstrapping means launching commands when a machine starts
* That script is only run once at the instance first start
* EC2 user data is used to automate boot tasks such as:
  * Installing updates
  * Installing software
  * Downloading common files from the internet
  * Anything you can think of
* The EC2 User Data Script runs with the root user

# EC2 Instance Types - Overview
* You can use different types of EC2 instances that are optimised for different use cases (https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/)
* AWS has the following naming convention:
 >         # m5.2xlarge
  * m: instance class
  * 5: generation (AWS improves them over time)
  * 2xlarge: size within the instance class

## EC2 Instance Types – General Purpose
* Great for a diversity of workloads such as web servers or code repositories
* Balance between:
  * Compute
  * Memory
  * Networking

## EC2 Instance Types – Compute Optimized
* Great for compute-intensive tasks that require high performance
### processors:
* Batch processing workloads
* Media transcoding
* High performance web servers
* High performance computing (HPC)
* Scientific modeling & machine learning
* Dedicated gaming servers

## EC2 Instance Types – Memory Optimized
* Fast performance for workloads that process large data sets in memory
* Use cases:
  * High performance, relational/non-relational databases
  * Distributed web scale cache stores
  * In-memory databases optimized for BI (business intelligence)
  * Applications performing real-time processing of big unstructured data

## EC2 Instance Types – Storage Optimized
* Great for storage-intensive tasks that require high, sequential read and write access to large data sets on local storage
* Use cases:
  * High frequency online transaction processing (OLTP) systems
  * Relational & NoSQL databases
  * Cache for in-memory databases (for example, Redis)
  * Data warehousing applications
  * Distributed file systems
