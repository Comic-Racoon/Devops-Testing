# Common Mistakes to Avoid in Containerizing Applications

## Do not combine multiple applications into one image.
- Build modular images that solve one specific problem, such as separate images for a web server and a database.
- Each image should have its own libraries and dependencies.

## Do not store data or state inside a container.
- Containers are ephemeral and can be destroyed and brought back online without losing data.
- Store data in external volumes or caching services like Redis.

## Keep the size of images as small as possible.
- Smaller images can be pulled faster from remote repositories and spun up more easily.
- Use minimal versions of official operating systems as base images.
- Install only necessary libraries and packages for the application to run.
- Delete unnecessary files and clean up as much as possible.

## Differentiate between development and production environments.
- Development environments may have debug tools or extra packages not needed in production.
- Consider using different images for different environments.

## Use multi-stage builds to optimize Dockerfiles.
- Avoid creating separate images for builder and production purposes.
- Only include required files in the build context.
- Use `.dockerignore` file to exclude unwanted files from the build context.
