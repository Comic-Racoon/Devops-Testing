# Importance of Code Formatting with Terraform fmt

## Introduction
- Code formatting enhances readability and maintainability of Terraform configurations.
- Terraform provides the `terraform fmt` command to automatically format Terraform code.

## Need for Formatting
- Readable code improves collaboration and understanding among team members.
- Consistent formatting ensures uniformity across the codebase.

## Formatting with terraform fmt
- `terraform fmt` command rewrites Terraform configuration files to enforce consistent formatting.
- Improves indentation, alignment, and overall structure of the code.
- Example: Before `terraform fmt`, code may lack proper indentation and alignment.
- After `terraform fmt`, code is formatted consistently for better readability.

## Practical Demonstration
- Example: Sample Terraform configuration file (test-fmt.tf) with inconsistent formatting.
- Running `terraform fmt` command automatically formats the code.
- Resulting code is more structured, with improved indentation and alignment.

## Conclusion
- Proper code formatting is essential for maintaining clean and readable Terraform configurations.
- Use `terraform fmt` regularly to ensure consistent formatting standards across the codebase.
- Consistently formatted code improves collaboration, code reviews, and overall code quality.
