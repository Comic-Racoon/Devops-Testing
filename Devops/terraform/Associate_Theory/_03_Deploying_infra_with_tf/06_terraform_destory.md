## Destroying Resources in TerraForm:

### Destroying All Resources:
- The `terraform destroy` command terminates all resources created within a specific folder.
- This approach is useful when all resources within the folder need to be removed simultaneously.

### Destroying Specific Resources:
- To destroy specific resources without affecting others, use the `-target` flag followed by the resource type and local resource name.
- The `-target` flag focuses destruction on a subset of resources, identified by their combination of resource type and local resource name.
- This approach allows for fine-grained control over which resources are terminated, preventing unintended removal of other resources.
