Basics of Infrastructure as Code

    Manual Infrastructure Management vs. Automation

        Manual approach: 
            E.g.: Taking database backup manually every night at 10:00 PM and uploading to S3 due to lack of time initially.
        Automation approach: 
            E.g.: Creating a Python script scheduled with Cron to automate the backup process, improving efficiency.
            
            Learning: Automation is crucial for repeatable tasks to avoid wasting time.
            Choice of automation tool depends on the task: Python used for database backup automation.

Importance of Automation in Infrastructure Management
    Single Service Deployment 
        Example : 
        Manual configuration leads to time-consuming and error-prone process, especially for replicating configurations across environments.

        Automation with Infrastructure as Code (IAC) tools ensures consistent deployment across environments.
        Example: Using Terraform or CloudFormation to deploy identical infrastructure configurations in development, staging, and production environments.

Introduction to Infrastructure as Code (IAC)
    
    Definition: Managing and provisioning infrastructure through code instead of manual processes.
    
    Example: Creating a new server in AWS manually vs. using CloudFormation or Terraform to deploy infrastructure via code.
    Choice of IAC tool depends on organization's preferences and requirements.

Benefits of Infrastructure as Code

    Speed of infrastructure management: 
        Once code is written, deployment across multiple environments is fast and repeatable.
    
    Low risk of human errors: 
        Automation reduces the likelihood of configuration mistakes.
    
    Version control: 
        Code can be managed, tracked, and collaborated on using version control systems like GitHub.
    
    Easy collaboration between teams: 
        Code stored in repositories facilitates collaboration among team members for infrastructure management.
