# Using Locals within Terraform Modules

## Introduction
- Using variables inside modules allows for customization but can lead to unintended overrides
- Repetitive values in modules can make code difficult to maintain

## Challenges with Variables
- Users can override variable values, potentially causing inconsistencies
- Repetitive values in modules increase maintenance efforts

## Implementing Locals
- Locals provide a way to define values within a module without allowing overrides
- Prevents users from modifying values unintentionally or intentionally
- Increases maintainability by centralizing repetitive values


## Conclusion
- Locals offer a solution to centralize repetitive values in modules
- Prevents unintended overrides by users, enhancing control and security
- Improves code maintainability by reducing redundancy and providing a centralized source for values
