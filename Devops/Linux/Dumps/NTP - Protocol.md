The Network Time Protocol (NTP) is a networking protocol used for clock synchronization between computer systems over packet-switched, variable-latency data networks. It's designed to synchronize the clocks of computers to a time reference, typically from coordinated universal time (UTC) servers. This ensures accurate timekeeping across various devices and networks.

NTP operates in a hierarchical manner, with primary servers (stratum 1 servers) obtaining time from highly accurate sources like atomic clocks or GPS receivers. These primary servers then distribute time to secondary servers (stratum 2 servers), which further distribute time to clients and other devices.

NTP uses a hierarchical system of time servers to provide increasing levels of accuracy and reliability as you move closer to stratum 0, which represents the most accurate time sources. It employs algorithms to adjust for network latency and asymmetry, ensuring precise time synchronization.

Accurate timekeeping is crucial for various applications, including network security, distributed computing, financial transactions, and telecommunications. NTP helps maintain consistency in timestamps across systems, which is essential for coordination and troubleshooting in distributed environments.
